Personal Questions:
    -Tell me about yourself:
        I am an aspiring software developer. I fell in love with computers when i was 12
        Worked in IT since high school. Then went on to study computer engineering for this
        reason. But I fell in love more with programming during my studies. I am really
        excited to kickstart my career in software development, currently I am an intern at
        a startup company which actually helped me a lot despite the lack of time that i have been
        there because I am the only intern there and the lead developer puts all the effort in helping me
        develop. I love creating and designing different programs and algorithms, learning new
        things and redefing my skills.  
    -How would people describe you?:
        I would say that people describe me as a good communicator because I always listen
        closetly to the task ahead and try to understand it as clearly as possible.
    -Why you wish to join Interorient and what is your aim?:
        It's a great opportunity to kickstart my carrer in software development, per my knowledge
        you have a great working environment and I am willing to learn and overcome every task and obstacle
        that you put in front of me
    -Which is your most significant accomplishment?:
        Outside my internship I did not had any significant proffesional acccomplishments.But
        On a personal level I have to say that my time in special forces was a nice experience
        in my life. Looking back watching how I grew as a person and as a human.
    -What is your greatest strength?:
        I'm highly motivated and extremely passionate about developing. Coding was just a hobby
        for me about 2 years ago, so I will work very hard to be able to do what I like on a daily 
        basis and also make a living out of it.
    -What is your greatest weakness?:
        I would say that my biggest weakness it that I am an undergraduate and I don't have much 
        professional experience but I will not let this minor setback stop me. I have a good work ethic
        and I am a fast learner.
    -Tell me about a time when you had to work through some negativity to get some work done?:
        Well my grandmother had past away this february she had alzhaimers for years. I was at Ioannina 
        at a time and my semester exams where like 2 days away if i remember correctly. It was a tought time
        but I couldn't just close the books and say i cant study right now or something like this.
    -Tell me about teamwork?:
        Teamwork is a necessary component to success for every company, there are many people
        working at every company with different backgrounds/personality/believes and everyone

        to pick up but also it's a very powerfull language and one of the most popular ones
        I also like Java because it was the first programming language i went quite in-depth
        and made me fall in love with coding.
    -What is a class? Super-Class? Abstract Class:
        Class is the blueprint for creating objects. Class contains the methods and variables which are a class instance.
        Super-Class is the basis of the class under consideration.
        A class having the keyword abstract is called an abstract class
    -Constructor? Default Constructor? Parametereized Constructor?:
        A Constructor is the way to initiate a class/ create a class Object.It's the first thing that is being called when you initiate the class
        Default Construcotr either has no arguments or all the arguments have default values
        Parameterized Constructor takes some arguments to pass them
    -OOP Principles?:
        1) Encapsulati  on 2) Abstraction 3) Inheritance 4) Polymorphism
    -Multiple Inheritance? Advantages/Disadvantages?:
        Multiple Inheritance is the process where a subclass can derived from more than one super class
        Advantage: Class can inherit the functionality of more than one base class
        Disadvantage: It can lead to a lot of confusion when two base classes implement a method with the same name
    -SDLC:
        Software Development Life Cycle: 1)Planning 2)Design 3)Construction 4)Testing 5) Deployment
    -Inheritance:
        Inheritance is simillar to a class, but it is a collection of abstract methods. A class
        can have more than one interface.
        Inheritance is an oop concept in which one class derives the properties of the rest
        of the classes
    -Interface:
        Is a collection of abstract methods which lay out the required behavior of any class that implements it 
    -Algorithm?:
        Is a rule or step-by-step process that must be followed in order to solve a problem
    -Access Modifiers:
        Private : visible to a particular class
        Public : visible to everyone
        Protected : Visible to a specific pakcage as well as a subclass
    -Git and Github:
        -Git init: creates a new git repository- probably will never use it 
        -Git status: inpsects the contents in the working directory
        -Git add: adds files from the working directory to the staging area
        -Git diff: shows the difference between the working directory
        -Git commit: peramenently stores files changes from the staging area to the area in the repository
        -Git log: shows a list of all previous commits
        -Why use git: Keep track of changes made to a project
    -Linux:
        -Linux: Open source software-Programmers can design their own, Free Licences for server and user,
        Low issues with virus or malware
        -Permission: chmod - +add, -deny 
        -Pwd: print working directory - current working location
        -Cd: change directory
        -mkdir: Create a new directory
        -rmdir: remove a directory
        -CTRL+Alt+DEL : restart the system without confirmation 
    -A REST API: (also known as RESTful API) 
        Is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural 
        style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. 
        REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
    -Class level scope: 
        If its a private variable it can be accessed only inside the class. 
        If it's public it can be accessed outside the class.
    -Method Level Scope: 
        When a variable is declared inside the method then it is not accesible outside that method
    -Block scope:
        Any variable declared in a for loop condition is not accesible
        after the loop is finished you cannot access it unless it was initialized beforehand
    -Static:
        Is a keyword that can be added after the access modifier of a method or a variable.
        It indicates that the declared entity is the same across all instances of that class 
        and that it can be accessed even before an object of that class is created
    -Method overriding:
        It is a feature that allows a subclass to have a method with the same name
        and parameters as one declared in its parent class.
    -Method overloading:
        With overloading a class can have multiple methods with the same name if they have 
        different parameter lists
    -Constructor overloading:
        This gives the option to initiate an object with different sets of arguments.
    -(==) vs equals:
        When we use == operator it checks if they have the same addresses in the string constant pool
        but if we use equals the result is the comparison of the 2 values
    -Casting:  
        Type Casting is the process of converting a value of one primitive data type to another 
        primitive data type. Data types are classified as "lower" if they hold less data
        and "higher" if they hold more data
    -Dictionary:
        Is an abstract class that stores key-value pairs. Given a key you can retrieve the value
        that is associated with that key.Hashtable is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in a hashtable, very similar to HashMap
    -Framework:
        Is often a layered structure indicating what kind of 
        programs can or should be built and how they would interrelate
    -API:  
        Application Program Interface, it allows applications to interact with 
        another piece of software.
    -Scope Pollution:
        When you declare global variables they go the global namespace. The global
        namespace allows the vartiables to be accessible from anywhere in the program.
        These variables remain there until the program finishes which means our global
        namespace can fill up really quickly. Scope pollution is when we have too many
        global variables remain there until the program finishes which means our global namespace
        can fill up really quickly
    
IQ Test:
    -First: A bussinessman purchased 30 TV sets in Rs 300000 if the average cost of 15 TV
    sets is Rs.9000 then find out the average cost of remaining TV sets.
        Total Cost of 30 TV Sets = Rs.300000
        Total Cost of 15 Tv sets = 9000 x 15 = 135 000
        Total cost of remaining 15 tv sets = 300 000 - 135 000 = 165 000
        Average cost of remaining Tv sets = 165 000/ 15 = Rs.11 000
    -Second: Find the average of first 5 consecutive even numbers starting from 2 to 10
    where the last even number is 10.
    
    -Third: A cube of 3x3x3 is painted from all the 6 faces. If i cut the cube in 27
    equal cubes of 1x1x1 then hwo many cubes will be painted on exactly? 12

    -Fourth: The average of 8 numbers is 14, The average of 6 numbers is 16.what 
    is the average of the remaining two numbers? A)12 B)6 C)8 D)10 
        Average of 8 numbers = 14 => Sum of 8 numbers = 14x8 = 112
        Average of 6 numbers = 16 => Sum of 6 numbers = 16x6 = 96
        Therefore the sum of 2 = Sum of 8 - Sum of 6 = 112-96 = 16
        Average = Sum of 2/ 2 = 16/2 = 8
    -Fifth: What months have 28 days?
        Every month has 28 days, but if you specify only 28 days then 
        February except 1 in 4 years
    -Six: You enter a dark room and only have one match. What do you light first. An oil heater,
    an oil lamp or a candle?
        You light the match first. Considering it is lighted then you light the candle
        but what if you do not have the matches case
    -Seven: You paid 1.10 for a ball and something and the something was 1 dollar more
    How much was the ball? 
        0.05 something or ball and the other was 1.05
    -Eight: Lilys in a lake need 48 days to fill. How many days does it take to fill fully if every day
    fills halve more than yesterday? 47 days will be halve full
    -Nine: Assuming you are driving the buss,.....: Who is driving the buss? me?
    -Ten: What is the half of 2+2?
       Depends of how you write it could be either 2 or 3
        1/2 (2+2) = 2  
        (1/2*2) + 2 = 3
