Node Class:
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, value, next_node=None):
            self.value = value
            self.next_node = next_node
            
        def set_next_node(self, next_node):
            self.next_node = next_node
            
        def get_next_node(self):
            return self.next_node

Queues: A queue is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.
        3 methods of interaction
        -Enqueue: adds data to the back or end of the queue (Way of saying Add to Queue)
        -Dequeue: provides and removes data from the "front" or beginning of the queue
        -Peek: reveals data from the "front" of the queue without removing it
        -Contains data nodes
        -Can implemented using a linked list or array
        -Bounded queues have a limited size
        -Enqueueing onto a full queue causes a queue overflow
        -Queues process data First in, First Out (FIFO)
